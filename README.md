# Sales-Analysis-On-Store-Data-

I  use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 3 years worth of sales data. The data contains thousands of store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

We have answered these 5 questions through our data analysis mainly using pandas and matplotlib library.

Q1. What is the overall sales trend?
Q2. Which are the Top 10 products by sales?
Q3. Which are the Most Selling Products?
Q4. Which is the most preferred Ship Mode?
Q5. Which are the Most Profitable Category and Sub-Category?
